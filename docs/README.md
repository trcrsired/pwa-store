# 🌐 PWA Store

A free and open-source hub for discovering and installing Progressive Web App wrappers.

## 🎯 What is this?

Many websites don’t offer proper PWA support—but that doesn’t mean they can’t be wrapped and transformed into installable experiences. This repository is a centralized launcher for custom PWA wrappers that empower users to install and navigate the web more securely and freely.

## 💡 Why?

- 🧩 **Discovery** — PWAs are often hard to find or inconsistently supported.
- 🛠️ **Compatibility** — With custom wrappers, any site can behave like a PWA—even if its developers never shipped one.
- 🗽 **Freedom & Security** — Users should be able to install wrappers for any web destination they choose—including controversial or neglected categories—because excluding them can introduce broader security risks.

## 🚀 How?

Each subdirectory holds a self-contained wrapper for a web app. These wrappers are exposed via GitHub Pages so anyone can install them from a clean, unified interface.

Built with:
- ✨ Modular HTML/JS/CSS
- 🔧 Per-site install logic and spoofing strategies
- ⚙️ Service worker caching and manifest support

> This store welcomes wrappers for all kinds of websites—even those that are political, adult-themed, or otherwise excluded by mainstream platforms. Excluding these creates deeper risks: less transparency, less user control, and more fragmentation. Digital freedom means respecting _every_ user’s right to choose.
